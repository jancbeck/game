# Gameplay Guide

## Story Context

You are the Nameless Hero, the one who saved Khorinis and defeated the dragons. But victory came at a cost. The world is recovering, but scars remain—both physical and psychological. 

The mines that once crawled with orcs now stand eerily quiet. The people you saved are trying to rebuild their lives, but strange occurrences suggest that not all threats have been vanquished. Whispers speak of dark forces still lurking, of Beliar's lingering influence.

Your journey doesn't end with victory. It continues in the aftermath.

## How to Play

### Movement
Walk around using WASD or Arrow keys. The camera follows your character (blue rectangle).

### Interacting with NPCs
When you approach an NPC (orange rectangle), you'll see a prompt: "Press E to interact"

Press **E** or **Space** to start a conversation.

### Dialogue System

The dialogue system is inspired by Disco Elysium:

1. **Read the dialogue**: The NPC's name and their words appear at the bottom of the screen
2. **Choose your response**: Click on one of the available options
3. **Skill checks**: Some options require a skill check, shown as `[Skill X/Y]` where:
   - X is your current skill level
   - Y is the difficulty threshold
   - The game rolls 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and adds your skill value
   - If the total meets or exceeds the difficulty, you succeed!

4. **Results**: 
   - Success leads to one conversation path
   - Failure leads to another
   - You'll see a notification showing if you passed or failed

### Character Sheet (Press C)

View your character's stats:

- **Primary Attributes**: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics
- **Skills**: Logic, Rhetoric, Empathy, Authority, Perception, Endurance, Pain Threshold, Shivers
- **Health and Morale**: Your physical and mental well-being

Each skill is calculated from your primary attributes.

### Thought Cabinet (Press T)

The Thought Cabinet is a unique system where you can internalize thoughts about your experiences. Each thought provides bonuses or penalties to your stats.

Available thoughts include:
- **"The Weight of Victory"**: Empathy +1, but Morale -5 (trauma from the war)
- **"Slayer of Dragons"**: Authority +2, Pain Threshold +1 (confidence from your achievements)
- **"Memories of Khorinis"**: Perception +1, Shivers +1 (nostalgia and awareness)
- **"Touched by Darkness"**: Shivers +2, but Empathy -1 and Health -10 (corrupted by evil)

## Game Mechanics Explained

### Skill Checks (2d6 System)

When you encounter a skill check:
1. The game rolls two six-sided dice (results: 2-12)
2. Your skill value is added to the roll
3. If the total meets or exceeds the difficulty, you succeed

Example: 
- Your Rhetoric skill is 4
- The difficulty is 8
- You roll 5 (2+3 on the dice)
- Total: 4 + 5 = 9
- 9 ≥ 8 → **SUCCESS!**

### Skills and Their Uses

- **Logic**: Solve puzzles, spot logical flaws, analyze situations
- **Rhetoric**: Persuade, argue, negotiate
- **Empathy**: Understand emotions, comfort others, read intentions
- **Authority**: Command respect, intimidate, lead
- **Perception**: Notice details, find clues, see what others miss
- **Endurance**: Survive harsh conditions, resist fatigue
- **Pain Threshold**: Endure physical pain, push through injuries
- **Shivers**: Sixth sense, premonitions, connection to the world

### Attributes

Your four primary attributes determine your skill values:

- **Intellect**: The mind's raw processing power (affects Logic, Rhetoric, Perception)
- **Psyche**: Emotional and mental stability (affects Empathy, Rhetoric, Authority, Shivers)
- **Physique**: Physical strength and constitution (affects Endurance, Pain Threshold, Authority)
- **Motorics**: Body control and coordination (affects Perception, Shivers)

## Example Dialogue Flow

1. Approach the Old Miner NPC
2. Press E to interact
3. He greets you, mentioning your heroic deeds
4. You can choose:
   - Ask about the aftermath (normal option)
   - [Rhetoric 8] Try to persuade him (requires a skill check)
   - [Perception 7] Notice something off about him (requires a skill check)
   - Leave the conversation

5. If you choose a skill check option:
   - The game performs the check
   - Success: You get special information or a better outcome
   - Failure: The conversation takes a different path

## Tips

1. **Explore different dialogue options**: Each choice leads to different outcomes
2. **Check your stats regularly (C)**: Understand your strengths and weaknesses
3. **Try skill checks**: Even if your skill is lower than the difficulty, you might roll high!
4. **Read the Thought Cabinet (T)**: Learn about thoughts you can internalize
5. **Pay attention to skill check results**: They tell a story about your character's capabilities

## Demo Content

This demo includes:
- 2 NPCs to interact with (both use the same dialogue tree)
- Multiple dialogue branches
- Several skill check opportunities (Rhetoric, Perception, Empathy, Authority)
- 4 thoughts in the Thought Cabinet
- Full stat system with 4 attributes and 8 skills

## Lore Integration

The game references:
- **Khorinis**: The island where Gothic 2 took place
- **Dragons**: The main threat you defeated
- **Orcs**: Former enemies, now gone
- **Beliar**: The dark god, whose influence may still linger
- **The Mines**: Location of much conflict during the war
- **Post-war trauma**: The psychological impact of the conflict

This creates a bridge between Gothic's world and Disco Elysium's psychological depth.
