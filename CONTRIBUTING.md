# Contributing to Gothic Chronicles: The Aftermath

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install development tools**: `make install-tools`
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Run checks**: `make check`
5. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Godot 4.2+** - [Download here](https://godotengine.org/download)
- **Python 3.12+** - For linting tools
- **Make** - For convenience commands (optional)

### Install Tools

```bash
# Install Python linting tools
make install-tools

# Or manually
pip install gdtoolkit==4.2.2
```

### Pre-commit Hook (Mandatory for Coding Agents)

For coding agents, the pre-commit hook is automatically installed via the `copilot-setup-steps` workflow. This ensures all commits are linted before being pushed.

For manual setup:

```bash
cp .git-hooks/pre-commit.example .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Run Checks

```bash
# Format your code
make format

# Check linting
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Or run everything
make check
```

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description of changes"
```

Commit message format:
- **feat:** New feature
- **fix:** Bug fix
- **test:** Add or update tests
- **docs:** Documentation changes
- **refactor:** Code refactoring
- **style:** Formatting changes

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Code Style

### GDScript Guidelines

- Use **static typing** whenever possible
- Follow **snake_case** for variables and functions
- Follow **PascalCase** for classes
- Keep lines under **100 characters**
- Use **tabs for indentation** (Godot default)
- Add **docstrings** for public functions

Example:
```gdscript
class_name MyClass
extends Node

## Brief description of the class
## More details if needed

var health: int = 100
var player_name: String = "Hero"


func calculate_damage(base_damage: int, modifier: float) -> int:
	"""Calculate final damage after applying modifier"""
	return int(base_damage * modifier)
```

### File Organization

```
game/
â”œâ”€â”€ scenes/          # .tscn files
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/         # .gd files
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/           # Test files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ unit/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2e/
â””â”€â”€ addons/          # Third-party addons
```

## Testing

All new features should include tests. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for details.

### Writing Tests

```gdscript
extends GutTest

var my_system: MySystem


func before_each():
	my_system = MySystem.new()
	add_child_autofree(my_system)


func test_something_works():
	var result = my_system.do_something()
	assert_true(result, "Should return true")
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific suite
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-e2e
```
