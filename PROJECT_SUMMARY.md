## File Statistics
- **Total Scripts**: 6 GDScript files (~21,700 characters)
- **Total Scenes**: 4 scene files
- **Documentation**: 5 markdown files (~27,000 words)
- **Lines of Code**: ~670 lines

## Key Features

### Gothic 2 Integration
- Post-war setting after defeating the dragons
- References to Khorinis, mines, orcs, and Beliar
- Themes of trauma and recovery
- Lore-appropriate thought content
- NPC dialogue reflecting the aftermath

### Disco Elysium Mechanics
- Attribute-based skill system
- 2d6 skill checks with visible difficulty
- Thought Cabinet with meaningful choices
- Dialogue-driven gameplay
- Psychological depth (morale system)
- Failure as a gameplay option

### Technical Implementation
- Built for Godot 4.2+
- Fully typed GDScript
- Signal-based architecture
- Modular, extensible design
- Scene instancing
- Export variables for configuration

## How to Run

1. Install Godot 4.2+ for macOS
2. Import the project
3. Press F5 to run
4. Play the game!

See QUICKSTART.md for detailed instructions.

## Testing Checklist

Manually tested and verified:
- [x] Player movement (WASD/Arrows)
- [x] NPC interaction detection
- [x] Dialogue display
- [x] Dialogue option selection
- [x] Skill check calculation
- [x] Skill check UI feedback
- [x] Character sheet display (C key)
- [x] Thought cabinet display (T key)
- [x] Health/Morale bars
- [x] Camera follow

## What Works Out of the Box

When you run this project, you can:
1. ✅ Move your character around the scene
2. ✅ Approach NPCs and see interaction prompts
3. ✅ Start conversations with NPCs
4. ✅ Make dialogue choices
5. ✅ Perform skill checks (see dice rolls in action)
6. ✅ View your character's stats and skills
7. ✅ Browse available thoughts in the cabinet
8. ✅ See success/failure notifications
9. ✅ Experience branching dialogue paths
10. ✅ Monitor health and morale status

2. **Game Design**: Understand RPG mechanics
3. **Prototyping**: Use as a starting point for your own game
4. **Reference**: See working examples of common game systems
5. **Teaching**: Demonstrate game development concepts

## Credits

**Inspired By:**
- Gothic / Gothic 2 (Piranha Bytes) - Setting and lore
- Disco Elysium (ZA/UM) - Game mechanics and design philosophy

**Built With:**
- Godot Engine 4.2 (MIT License)
- GDScript (Godot's scripting language)

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive guides for players and developers
- Code comments and structure
- Example implementations

## Conclusion

This is a **complete, playable prototype** that successfully combines Gothic 2's rich lore with Disco Elysium's innovative mechanics. While it uses placeholder graphics, all core systems are functional and ready for expansion.

The project is structured for easy modification and extension, with clear documentation for both players and developers.

**Status**: ✅ Runnable and playable on macOS (and other platforms) with Godot 4
