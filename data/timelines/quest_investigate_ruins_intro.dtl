rebel_leader: You've returned. Good. The prisoner is safe?
- Yes. It is done.
	rebel_leader: Efficient. I like that.
- It was messy, but they are free.
	rebel_leader: Freedom is rarely clean.
rebel_leader: But we have no time to celebrate. The scouts report a disturbance at the Old Ruins.
rebel_leader: A pulse of energy. Dark. Corrupting. It feels... familiar.
rebel_leader: I need you to investigate. If the King's sorcerers have found a way to tap into the Void, we are all doomed.
- I will go at once.
	rebel_leader: Be careful. That place changes people.
- What should I look for?
	rebel_leader: Anything that feels wrong. You will know it when you see it.
- I am tired of your errands.
	rebel_leader: And I am tired of this war. Go. We all make sacrifices.
